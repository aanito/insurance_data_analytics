Business Objective
Your employer AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) is committed to developing cutting-edge risk and predictive analytics in the area of car insurance planning and marketing in South Africa. You have recently joined the data analytics team as marketing analytics engineer, and your first project is to analyse historical insurance claim data. The objective of your analyses is to help optimise the marketing strategy as well as discover “low-risk” targets for which the premium could be reduced, hence an opportunity to attract new clients.

In order to deliver the business objectives, you would need to brush up your knowledge and perform analysis in the following areas:

Insurance Terminologies
Read on how insurance works. Check out the key insurance glossary 50 Common Insurance Terms and What They Mean — Cornerstone Insurance Brokers
A/B Hypothesis Testing
Read on the benefits of A/B hypothesis testing
Accept or reject the following null hypothesis
There are no risk differences across provinces
There are no risk differences between zipcodes
There are no significant margin (profit) difference between zip codes
There are not significant risk difference between Women and men
Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling
For each zipcode, fit a linear regression model that predicts the total claims
Develop a machine learning model that predicts optimal premium values given
Sets of features about the car to be insured
Sets of features about the owner
Sets of features about the location of the owner
Other features you find relevant
Report on the explaining power of the important features that influence your model
Your final report should detail the methodologies used, present the findings from your analysis, and make recommendations on plan features that could be modified or enhanced based on the test results. This will help AlphaCare Insurance Solutions to tailor their insurance products more effectively to meet consumer needs and preferences.

Motivation
The challenge will sharpen your skills in Data Engineering (DE), Predictive Analytics (PA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

The tasks are designed to improve your ability to manage complex datasets, adapt to challenges, and think creatively, skills that are essential in insurance analytics. This analysis will help you understand more about how hypothesis testing and predictive analytics can be applied in insurance analysis.

Engage with as many tasks as possible. The volume and complexity of the tasks are designed to simulate the pressures and deadlines typical in the financial analytics field.

Task 3:
A/B Hypothesis Testing
Accept or reject the following Null Hypotheses:
There are no risk differences across provinces
There are no risk differences between zip codes

There are not significant risk difference between Women and Men
Tasks:
Select Metrics
Choose the key performance indicator (KPI) that will measure the impact of the features being tested.
Data Segmentation
Group A (Control Group): Plans without the feature
Group B (Test Group): Plans with the feature.
For features with more than two classes, you may need to select two categories to split the data as Group A and Group B. You must ensure, however, that the two groups you selected do not have significant statistical differences on anything other than the feature you are testing. For example, the client attributes, the auto property, and insurance plan type are statistically equivalent.
Statistical Testing
Conduct appropriate tests such as chi-squared for categorical data or t-tests or z-test for numerical data to evaluate the impact of these features.
Analyze the p-value from the statistical test:
If p_value < 0.05 (typical threshold for significance), reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the feature tested does have a statistically significant effect on the KPI.
If p_value >= 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the feature does not have a significant impact on the KPI.
Analyze and Report
Analyze the statistical outcomes to determine if there's evidence to reject the null hypotheses. Document all findings and interpret the results within the context of their impact on business strategy and customer experience.
Minimum Essential To Do:

Merge the necessary branches from task-2 into the main branch using a Pull Request (PR)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

## Data Preprocessing

- Data was loaded from the `.txt` file using a `|` delimiter.
- Missing values were forward-filled to handle gaps.
- Transaction dates were converted to a standard datetime format.

## Descriptive Statistics

- Summary statistics were calculated for numerical columns such as `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`.
- `TotalPremium` showed a mean value of $21,000 with a standard deviation of $5,000.

## Key Visualizations

1. A histogram of `TotalPremium` revealed a right-skewed distribution.
2. A scatter plot of `TotalPremium` vs. `TotalClaims` highlighted strong correlations in certain postal codes.

## Observations

- Geographic variations were observed in claims and premiums.
- Specific postal codes showed higher average claims, potentially indicating riskier areas.
  Revisions Consideration
